# Employee Attrition Prediction

### "An average company loses between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed."

- The cost of hiring a new employee averages $7,645 for small to mid-sized businesses.
- It takes 52 days on average to fill an open position.

Given these significant costs, understanding which employees are likely to leave becomes vital. By leveraging predictive analytics, companies can take proactive steps to minimize attrition, retain key talent, and reduce costs associated with turnover.

In this project, we use **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to predict employee attrition, helping HR teams identify at-risk employees before they leave. With this knowledge, companies can implement retention strategies, ultimately saving time, money, and talent.

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using data on various factors such as job satisfaction, workload, and performance. The aim is to provide businesses with actionable insights that can reduce turnover and improve employee retention.

### Why Predicting Attrition Matters:
- **Cost-saving**: Reduce the high cost of replacing employees.
- **Efficiency**: Prevent gaps in productivity caused by long hiring processes.
- **Employee morale**: Maintain a stable, motivated workforce.

## Key Features:
- Built an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using **TensorFlow** to predict attrition likelihood.
- Preprocessed data, performed feature scaling, and evaluated the model's performance.
- Visualized data trends and model metrics using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and model performance tracking.

## Results:
The model effectively predicts the likelihood of employee attrition, providing valuable insights into which factors contribute the most to attrition risk. This allows HR teams to take preemptive action and reduce turnover, saving both time and resources for the company.
